This post will explain how to install LAMP stack on Ubuntu 20.04. LAMP stack consists of the following components:

These components work together to host single or multiple dynamic websites that are stable in production.

#Installing Apache and allowing it through the firewall
Apache is an amazing open-source web server. Let's install it using the following commands:

$sudo apt install apache2

*Let's allow Apache through the firewall using the following command:
$sudo ufw allow in "Apache Full"
*You can always issue the "sudo ufw status" command to verify the changes:
$sudo ufw status

You can now go to the server URL (IP address) and the apache2 default page will be displayed on the screen.
